**PROJECT OVERVIEW : The project focuses on enhancing space mission safety by predicting and managing space debris collisions. Using a blend of Simplified General Perturbations (SGP4/SDP4) models and innovative machine learning techniques, including Deep Learning LSTM networks and Graph Neural Networks, this initiative aims to accurately forecast and strategically maneuver to avoid debris collisions. This approach promises to significantly improve the sustainability and safety of space operations through advanced predictive capabilities and strategic collision avoidance methods.
